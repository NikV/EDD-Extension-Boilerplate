# EDD Extension Boilerplate

The EDD Extension Boilerplate serves as a foundation and aims to provide a standardized guide for building extensions. Just download, tweak a few things, and you'll be able to get to the real code in no time!

## Features

* The Plugin Boilerplate is fully-based on the WordPress [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API).
* Uses [PHPDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) conventions to document the code.
* Example values are given, so you can see what needs to be changed.
* Uses a strict file organization scheme to make sure the assets are easily maintainable.

## Contents

The EDD Extension Boilerplate includes the following files:

* This README, a CHANGELOG, and a `gitignore` file.
* A subdirectory called `plugin-name` that represents the core plugin file.

## Installation

1. Copy the `plugin-name` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the *Plugins* dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads *TODO*
4. Click on *Activate*

This will activate the EDD Extension Boilerplate. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality, nothing will be added to WordPress; however, this demonstrates exactly how your plugin should behave while you're working with the Boilerplate.
